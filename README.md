Added three methods:


## changeSkinPartial
*Accepts: (NSMutableDictionary *)slotsToReplace*

**Dictionary format:**
>node name : replacement texture

Replaces the texture of any nodes mentioned in the slotsToReplace dictionary with their accompanying textures. Creates an NSMutableDictionary in memory containing the original textures, to easily swap back.

Created to serve my own needs: I have an avatar builder in my Sprite Kit game, and I need to swap out specific slots without changing the whole skin (so the player can choose different shirts, pants etc.).

### Usage:

```
NSDictionary* partReplacement = @{@"torso": @"goblin-torso", @"head": @"goblin-head"};

[goblin changeSkinPartial:partReplacement];
```


### Limitations:
* The replacement only goes one level deep, and any nested animations are ignored. Run the included project and you'll see the goblin's head and torso change when you click the mouse, but the original blinking eyes are still shown.
* The skeleton must be well-named, and your dictionary's keys must match the slot names specified in the skeleton's .json file.



## resetSkinPartial
Resets any changes made through changeSkinPartial; reverts the skeleton back to the textures used when the scene was created.
Should only be called after changeSkinPartial.


## colorizeSlots
*Accetps: (NSArray *)slotsToColorize withColor:(SKColor *)color andIntensity:(CGFloat)blendFactor*

Colorizes the slots listed in the slotsToColorize array using the specified color and blend factor.

Can be used to make a body part flash red, or to let the player change their hair/skin color.

### Usage:
```
NSArray* partsToColorize = @[@"head", @"left shoulder", @"torso"];
SKColor* color = [SKColor redColor];
[boy colorizeSlots:partsToColorize withColor:color andIntensity:1];
```

### Limitations:
* Again, the colorization only goes one level deep. You can see this with Spineboy's eyes in the included demo.
* The skeleton must be well-named, and your array values must match the slot names specified in the skeleton's .json file.
