Version 1.1

	Features
	- added non linear key frame support
	- modfied changeSkinPartial method and renamed to changeTexturePartial (if you rely on the old method, use changeTexturePartial as the syntax should be the same)
	- replaced changeSkinPartial with new method (changes the skin setting for each individiual slot instead of specific textures, which SHOULD be superior)
	- removed queueCount property as it seemed superfluous with being able to sequence animations now


	Bug Fixes
	- because of the new animation engine, slots are properly animated when changing skins
	
	Known Issues
